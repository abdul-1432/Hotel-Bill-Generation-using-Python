## Introduction

Generating hotel bills manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This Python program aims to automate the process and provide an accurate bill for customers. The program is designed to be user-friendly, allowing the hotel staff to quickly input the necessary details and obtain the total bill amount.

## Requirements

To run the Hotel Bill Generation program, you need the following:

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to view and edit the code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
https://github.com/abdul-1432/Hotel-Bill-Generation-using-Python
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hotel-bill-generation
```

## Usage

1. Open the Python script `hotel_bill.py` in your preferred text editor or IDE.

2. Modify the `TAX_RATE` constant if needed. By default, it is set to 0.1, representing a 10% tax rate. You may adjust it based on your hotel's tax regulations.

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python hotel_bill.py
```

4. Follow the instructions provided by the program to input the necessary details:

   - Enter the customer's name.
   - Enter the room charges.
   - Enter the charges for food and beverages consumed.
   - If there are any additional expenses, enter their total amount.

5. The program will then calculate and display the total bill amount, including tax.

6. If you wish to generate another bill for a different customer, simply run the script again.
